    "1. **Population.**\n",

The governments are too focus to        have a lot of construction going, without looking at the environmental effects.\n",

Ideally, the more populated a country, the higher GNI the country has. The Caribbean Island region is heavily depend on tourism industry. If the industry going pretty well, the GDP will develope pretty good as well.\n",

    "1. **The population variable has a stronger          correlation with CO2 emission** than with the      other variables, which is understandable        because **the more people there are; The more      pollution would be created due to human          activity**. However, the **number of population      in the region doesn't really reflect the        improved water source available**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. GNI per capita has the strongest correlation    with improved sanitation facilities, which      means **when a country's income rises, so does    the expenditure to enhanced sanitation          facilities** available to the population and      vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. A strong correlation between CO2 emissions      and GNI means **the more wealth a country,      the more economic activities that affected      the environmental, which increase             pollution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A strong correlation between 'improved water    source' and 'improved sanitation facilities'    means as **the water source of a country      become more available widely, the more people will have access to sanitation facilities.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "A large number of population in the region doesn't always reflect a big amount of GNI per capita, however it is very likely a country to have high pollution condition which might an impact of economy activities. The proportion of population also needs to be seen from the industry activities from each country e.g. country that has a large mining industry will impact more.\n",
    "Moreover, the wealthiest the country, the more likely a country to improve its water availability and sanitation facilities because it has more budget to spend."
